# Malware-Classification

ABSTRACT

Malware is malicious software (e.g. viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware) that damages or performs harmful actions on computer systems . In this Internet-age, many malware attacks happen that pose serious security threats to financial institutions and everyday users.In order to combat the proliferation of malware, new strategies are essential to quickly identify and classify malware samples so that their behavior can be analyzed. 
Machine learning approaches are becoming popular for classifying malware, however, most of the existing machine learning methods for malware classification use shallow learning algorithms (e.g. SVM). Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a deep learning approach, have shown superior performance compared to traditional learning algorithms, especially in tasks such as image classification.By converting malware binaries to grayscale images we can subsequently train a CNN for classification.
